	<h3>Level Sampling</h3>
	<p>Level sampling is an extension of pixel sampling where mipmaps are used for anti-aliasing without incurring high
		performance impacts. Mipmaps are lower resolution versions of an image stored in memory that are used for
		texture mapping depending on the nature of the texture being mapped. If that specific region of the texture
		does not require as much detail, lower resolution mipmaps are used, reducing computational costs without
		sacrificing quality. However, as mipmaps must be stored in memory, there are associated memory costs.</p>
	<p>Level sampling is used for texture mapping by calculating the necessary mipmap level for each pixel to be texture
		mapped, and using the appropriate mipmap level for that pixel. For nearest level mapping, the mipmap level
		chosen is just the nearest level to the calculated level value, while for linear level mapping, a weighted
		average of the two nearest mipmap levels are used to determine the pixel's color.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Sampling Techniques</h3>
	<p>There are three main techniques explored so far, pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling. Among the
		three techniques, pixel sampling is the fastest, only requiring a few calculations per pixel and not requiring
		any memory overhead, but it has a low anti-aliasing power and struggles with complex images. Level sampling is
		more effective than pixel sampling, but it costs more memory to store the additional mipmaps and depending on
		the type of sampling used, may incur additional computational costs. Supersampling is the most effective
		anti-aliasing method, however, it comes with the highest computational cost and takes up more space in memory as
		well, since a higher resolution image must be stored on memory in order for downsampling to be performed.</p>

	<p>The above images show the changes in the moire patterning with changes in pixel sampling and level sampling
		techniques. The greatest reduction in the patterning and general aliasing effects can be seen with the use of
		both nearest level sampling and bilinear pixel sampling on the bottom right, while with only nearest pixel
		sampling, as shown on the top left, a high degree of aliasing and moire patterning artifacts can be seen.</p>
	<p>When comparing the use of either only bilinear pixel sampling or only nearest level sampling, nearest level
		sampling seems to have better performance, with much less moire effects and a similar reduction in aliasing as
		compared to bilinear pixel sampling.</p>
