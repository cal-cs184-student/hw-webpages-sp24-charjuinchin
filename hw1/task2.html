	<h3>Supersampling</h3>
	<p>Supersampling is useful as a method of anti-aliasing as it allows for edges to be smoothed by finding the
		appropriate intermediate values for each pixel on the edges of rasterized objects through sampling multiple
		times per pixel. Supersampling at a given sample rate can be viewed as increasing the resolution of an image by
		the sample rate, and then downsampling to the original resolution. Therefore, each pixel in the original
		resolution is composed of multiple pixels at the higher resolution.</p>
	<p>Implementing supersampling first involves creating a sample buffer and rasterization bounding box that is scaled
		to the higher resolution image. Pixels within the bounding box are then tested using the three line test to
		check if they fall within the triangle. However, as the bounding box is scaled to the higher resolution, the
		coordinates of each pixel center must be scaled down to the original resolution to ensure correctness of the
		test. Once all the pixels have been tested and colored appropriately, the sample buffer would then contain the
		rasterized image at the higher resolution.</p>
	<p>To downsample the image, the algorithm looks at each pixel at the original resolution and finds the pixels in the
		sample buffer that correspond to the given pixel. The colors of the pixels in the sample buffer are then
		averaged and rasterized onto the final output. At the edges, since not all of the pixels in the sample buffer
		may fall within the triangle and thus be colored, intermediate values are generated during the averaging
		process.</p>

	<p>In the above images, we can see the difference made by super sampling in the same region of the image. Without
		supersampling (supersample rate = 1), aliasing can be seen where the triangle's edges are jagged and form a
		stair-like pattern, and parts of it even disappear entirely. With super sampling, however, these artifacts are
		reduced, with intermediate values filling in missing parts of the triangle to smoothen out the edges.</p>
	<p>When comparing supersample rates, we can see that the anti-aliasing is better at higher supersample rates. This
		is because of the range of possible intermediate values increases. At a supersample rate of 4, we can see that
		each pixel can only have 1 of 4 colors, while at a supersample rate of 16, there are 16 possible options, which
		allows for more definition at the edges.</p>
