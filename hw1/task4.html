	<h3>Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
	<img src="images/task4_1.png">
	<p>Barycentric coordinates are a coordinate system for triangles, and represents the distance of a given point from
		the vertices of a triangle. This coordinate system can be represented by &alpha;, &beta; and &gamma;, each of
		which ranges from 0 to 1, and the sum of the three values being 1. Taking &alpha; as an example, representing
		the distance from vertex A on an arbitrary triangle, a value of 1 would represent a point sitting on the vertex
		A, while a value of 0 would represent a point lying on the line BC. This coordinate system thus defines the
		center of a triangle with the coordinates of (&frac13;, &frac13;, &frac13;).</p>
	<p>This representation allows us to perform linear interpolation by calculating the color of a given pixel as a
		weighted average of the three differently colored vertices. For each pixel in the triangle, by multiplying the
		color of each vertex with their associated &alpha;, &beta;, or &gamma; values, the weighted average of the
		colors can be obtained and used to rasterize the triangle. Thus, points on each of the vertices A, B, and C will
		be entirely of their vertices' color, which is red, blue, and green respectively, while other points within the
		triangle will be composed of gradients along those color lines depending on location. </p>
