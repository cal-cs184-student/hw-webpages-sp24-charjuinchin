	<h3>Pixel Sampling</h3>
	<p>Pixel sampling is a technique where in order to find the color for a point on one object, we can convert between
		coordinate systems to obtain the desired color from an object in a different coordinate system. This allows us
		to perform texture mapping by using a given texture as the source for colors and apply it onto any arbitrary
		surface as long as the coordinate system conversion is done correctly.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Methods of Pixel Sampling</h3>
	<p>The simplest method of pixel sampling, also known as nearest pixel sampling, involves converting the coordinates
		of the pixel to be colored from the original coordinate system to that of the texture's coordinate system, then
		simply choosing the color of the closest pixel in the given texture. This technique is fast and provides a
		somewhat accurate image, but lacks the ability to smooth edges and suffers from aliasing and reduced detail if
		the resolution of the texture is lower than the output resolution.</p>
	<p>An alternative method of pixel sampling is bilinear pixel sampling, which involves aggregating the colors of the
		4 closest pixels in the given texture. While it costs more resources for rasterization, when properly
		implemented, this technique is relatively fast and reduces aliasing artifacts and sharpens the output. This
		allows for higher quality texture mapping without the need for other more expensive anti-aliasing techniques.

	<p>As can be seen in the above images, the image with the most aliasing artifacts is on the top left, where nearest
		pixel sampling is performed without supersampling. The edges of the landmasses are not smooth and the latitude
		and longitude lines are choppy and jagged. These artifacts are reduced with bilinear pixel sampling as shown in
		the bottom left image, with the edges of landmasses having more intermediate pixel values and the lines are
		smoothed out, though they still have some choppiness and missing segments. This shows how bilinear pixel
		sampling can achieve some anti-aliasing effects without the need for more computationally expensive techniques.
	</p>
	<p>However, supersampling is still extremely valuable, as can be seen in the images on the right, where most of the
		aliasing artifacts are removed, lines appear in full throughout the image, and the overall output quality is
		clearly better than the images without supersampling. This shows that despite the computational cost,
		supersampling is still valuable as a technique to improve image quality.</p>
