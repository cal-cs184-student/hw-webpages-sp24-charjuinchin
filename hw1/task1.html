	<h3>Rasterizing Triangles</h3>
	<p>Rasterizing triangles involves checking through every appropriate pixel in an image and identifying whether or
		not it falls within the inside of a triangle. To do this check, using the center of every pixel, we can use a
		function that uses cross-products to compare the pixel's location to that of a given line. If the pixel falls on
		the same side of all three lines, when looking in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, the pixel
		falls within the triangle. By finding all of these pixels and coloring them appropriately, we then complete
		rasterization of a triangle.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Bounding Boxes</h3>
	<p>To ensure that the algorithm does not check unnecessary pixels, the algorithm draws a bounding box around the
		given triangle, as defined as the minimum and maximum of the given x and y-coordinates for each point of the
		triangle. To ensure that the edges are fully checked, the floor of the minimums and ceil of the maximums are
		used to define the last pixel to be tested. Only pixel centers that fall strictly within these two values are
		tested. This ensures that efficiency is at least as efficient as sampling within the bounding box of the
		triangle.</p>
